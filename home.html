	<big><big>	❝ </big></big>In my combined 16 years working for the Tri-County Times, we have never, to my knowledge, buried a story that many of our readers would find fascinating — except one.

 What I am talking about occurred 20 years ago, in 1998.
 We received an anonymous tip from one of our readers that there was a crop circle in the backyard of a home on West Street, just south of the Ellen Street school building, before W. Shiawassee.

<br><br> Intrigued, we drove out there and parked on the street. We had to walk up the driveway of the little house and through the backyard. At the northwest corner of that backyard was a little opening that led us to another parcel of land, about a third of an acre in size.

 It was there that we saw a perfectly formed circle. Green and brown weeds had been woven into the circle that took up the majority of the parcel. It was huge.<br><br>

 <big><big><italic>This did not appear to be a natural occurrence, where a big wind gust or mini tornado flattened the weeds down into a circle.</big></big><italic>

<br><br> These weeds were actually woven together, braided like an old-fashioned rug or hot pad for the stove. I bent down to touch it and the woven weeds were tight and tied together.

 
 Even more odd, the weeds in the circle were woven into a counter clockwise direction. There were no breaks in the circle, no heavy equipment in sight, and no other footprints.

 We all stood there for a long time in disbelief.<br>
<br> <big><big><italic>Who or what could have done this? </big></big></italic>

 <br><br>I called Fenton police and was connected with an officer who thought this was all a joke and said no one was available to come out and take a look. The officer, who has since left the department, suggested we call some “UFO people.”

 We made a few other calls but were unsuccessful in getting anyone to take us seriously enough to come out and take a look for themselves.

 So, the decision was made to bury the story.

<br><br>
 Since the initial call we received was anonymous, we had no way of knowing if it was the homeowner, or a neighbor. We do know that the homeowner at the time sold the house in the fall of that same year, 1998.

 Crop circles became a phenomenon of the 1980s in this country.  While I am absolutely not suggesting that aliens created the West Street crop circle as a sign, I do continue to wonder who would take the time to weave together the weeds on a big parcel. It had to have taken hours, yet we were told it appeared overnight. But if it did happen that way, my next question is why? Why spend hours creating a crop circle on a back parcel of land, one that could not be seen from West Street or the side streets before and after it.
<br><br>
<br> <big><big><italic>Now YOU decide... aliens, something otherworldly or supernatural, or simply a conspiracy? </big></big></italic>
